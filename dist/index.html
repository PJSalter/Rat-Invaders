            Me-ouch! The mice have finally succeeded in their nefarious plan to
            invade your territory and infest your slumber nest with their cheesy
            little feet. Despite your valiant efforts to fend them off, their
            sheer numbers and relentless attacks proved too much for even a
            mighty feline like you. Your territory has fallen to the rodent
            horde, and they're throwing a cheesy victory party in your slumber
            nest as we speak. Don't worry, though--you'll have your revenge soon
            enough. Time to start planning your epic comeback!

            Looks like the mice didn't know who they were messing with when they
            tried to invade your territory, oh mighty feline! You clawed your
            way to victory and sent them running with their tails between their
            legs (and cheese in their paws). Your slumber nest is safe once
            again, thanks to your ferocious fighting skills and quick reflexes.
            Congratulations on being the top cat in town!
