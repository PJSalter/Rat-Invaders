            Me-ouch! The mice have finally succeeded in their nefarious plan to
            invade your territory and infest your slumber nest with their cheesy
            little feet. Despite your valiant efforts to fend them off, their
            sheer numbers and relentless attacks proved too much for even a
            mighty feline like you. Your territory has fallen to the rodent
            horde, and they're throwing a cheesy victory party in your slumber
            nest as we speak. Don't worry, though--you'll have your revenge soon
            enough. Time to start planning your epic comeback!
